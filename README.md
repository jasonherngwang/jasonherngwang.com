## About This Website

This is my personal website for experimenting and learning new things:

- Learning Next.js from the repos of [shadcn](https://github.com/shadcn), [leerob](https://github.com/leerob), and [steven-tey](https://github.com/steven-tey).
- Trying out the `app` dir.
- Setting up metadata in `layout`, and learning about OpenGraph and `og:image`.
- Serving fonts with `next/font`, and using Tailwind's `max-w-prose` for a comfortable reading width. Picking a font that is **NOT** Inter (I decided on [Satoshi](https://www.fontshare.com/fonts/satoshi)).
- `@ianvs/prettier-plugin-sort-imports` and `prettier.config.js` to auto sort imports.
- New Tailwind CSS v3.3 gradient color stops!
- Creating types and `config` files for nav items and project details.
- Converting images to `.webp` so Lighthouse will stop scolding me. Using [`plaiceholder`](https://github.com/joe-bell/plaiceholder) for blurring images.
- Using Husky to enforce conventional commit format.
- Learning the basics of Framer Motion from [Build UI](https://buildui.com/)
- Learning about IntersectionObserver from Josh Comeau's [The Joy of React](https://www.joyofreact.com/)
- Design inspo: [Onno Schwanen](https://onnoschwanen.com/), [Arda Karacizmeli](https://www.ardakaracizmeli.com/), [Diagram](https://diagram.com/)
