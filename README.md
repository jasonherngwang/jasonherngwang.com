## Seamless CI/CD

Recently I created [Seamless](https://seamless-cicd.com), an open-source CI/CD pipeline for containerized microservices.

Seamless is an open-source, low-config CI/CD pipeline for containerized microservice applications on ECS Fargate. It features a CLI for AWS deployment, a real-time dashboard, integration testing with Docker Compose, rollbacks, log storage in Redis, and parallel execution of pipelines.
