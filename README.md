## Seamless CI/CD

Recently I created [Seamless](https://seamless-cicd.com), an open-source CI/CD pipeline for containerized microservices.

Seamless is an open-source, low-config CI/CD pipeline for containerized microservice applications on ECS Fargate. It features a CLI for AWS deployment, a real-time dashboard, integration testing with Docker Compose, rollbacks, log storage in Redis, and parallel execution of pipelines.

## This Website

This is a simple website, but I still learned a lot while making it:
- Learning from repos of [shadcn](https://github.com/shadcn), [leerob](https://github.com/leerob), and [steven-tey](https://github.com/steven-tey)
- Trying out the `app` dir (basic usage)
- Setting up metadata in `layout`, and learning about OpenGraph and `og:image`
- Serving fonts with `next/font`, and using Tailwind `max-w-prose` for a comfortable reading width. Picking a font that is **NOT** Inter (➡️ went with Satoshi).
- `@ianvs/prettier-plugin-sort-imports` and `prettier.config.js` to auto sort imports
- New Tailwind CSS v3.3 gradient color stops!
- Creating types and `config` files for nav items and project details
- Converting images to webp and using plaiceholder for blur data while images are loading.
- Using Husky to enforce conventional commit format
- Design inspo: [Onno Schwanen](https://onnoschwanen.com/), [Arda Karacizmeli](https://www.ardakaracizmeli.com/), [Diagram](https://diagram.com/)
